# Welcome to my BSPWM adventure! 

I have to say, doing things from scratch aint easy. From the choice of distro to actually configuring things on your own, it can be annoying and time consuming. Borderline painful. 

Particularly, I want to make something using bspwm, something that looks nice and clean. So, I have set out to do this little by little, using Arch or Arch-based distros for the most flexibility.

Updating regularly as much as I have time! 

# What to expect

- A clean working environment;

- Not a whole lot of fluff;

- Matching themes;

- Very human design!

- Lots of updates for bugfixing and things not being too ready at the start.
